			"content": [
				<p>One thing that is deeply rooted is SoDA is helping its fellow members get their foot in the door with industry. We want students to become familiar with industry by helping them prepare for technical interviews, and showing them how and when to apply. Students who think and prepare sooner have a much easier time landing a job, and are much more successful during the job hunt itself.</p>,
				<p>SoDA has a few ways it plan to execute this goal. One of them is mock interviews. Mock interviews are one of the greatest ways to understand how companies test candidates before they hire. It gives you a chance to be put in that very important setting without all the pressure. You are able to understand what and how you will be tested, improving your chances to pass your interview.</p>,
				<p>All in all SoDA is here for you and your career questions/concerns.</p>
